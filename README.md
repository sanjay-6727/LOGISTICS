The Logistics Management System aims to streamline delivery operations for businesses by automating key processes such as order entry, vehicle assignment, route optimization, and delivery tracking. 
The system enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer satisfaction.

The objectives are: 
• Support order entry with comprehensive details, including product name, pickup and delivery locations, urgency level, weight, and volume.
• Assign appropriate vehicles (Bike, Van, Truck) based on order requirements.
• Optimize delivery routes using the A* algorithm, considering traffic and restrictions.
• Enable real-time tracking and accurate ETA predictions using machine learning.
• Provide detailed analytics for performance evaluation.
• Ensure intuitive user interfaces with minimal learning curve. • Minimize operational costs through efficient resource allocation.

System Architecture 
• Client Layer: Web dashboards with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
• Application Layer: Flask APIs for logic and ML integration. 
• Data Layer: SQLite with encrypted data. 
• ML Layer: Random Forest for ETA predictions.
